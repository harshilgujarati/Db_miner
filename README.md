The app provides users with a diverse collection of inspirational quotes, empowering them with personalized features and a visually appealing interface. "Quotes" aims to provide an immersive and personalized experience for users seeking inspiration and motivation. By incorporating SQLite Database, Animation, API Calling, Local JSON Bank, fetching and saving quotes, category-wise organization, light and dark themes, splash screen, detailed quote screens, random background images, and font families, quote wallpaper creation, and setting device wallpapers, the app offers a comprehensive solution for users to discover and engage with uplifting quotes that resonate with them.

The database allows for efficient categorization and management of the quotes. Animation: "Quotes" integrates animation techniques to create a dynamic and engaging user interface. Animations are applied to various UI elements, adding visual flair and enhancing the user experience. API Calling: The app leverages API calls to fetch additional quotes, expanding the collection beyond what is available in the Local JSON Bank. This ensures a diverse and ever-growing collection of inspirational quotes for users to explore.
